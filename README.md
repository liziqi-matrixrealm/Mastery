Note: the display hardware itself is limited to a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz.

Overview
========
Powered by **6-axis IMUs** along with **proprietary hardware and software algorithms**, **Mastery** captures nearly all **detailed movements** of the human hand with **high precision**, all while keeping **manufacturing costs low**. This enables users to interact in 3D environments in the most **natural, effortless, and comfortable** way possible.

The **glove form** provides an ideal platform for the **haptic feedback system** and **haptic sensing system** (currently featuring vibration motors).

For **computer 3D interaction**, unlike traditional controllers that rely on buttons, joysticks, and require handheld use, the device fully leverages natural hand movements, opening a new era of interaction. Just as smartphones replaced physical buttons with multi-touch screens, **Mastery** makes interaction more **intuitive, precise, and truly unleashes infinite imagination for interaction**.

For **embodied intelligence**, **Mastery** is the perfect device for collecting **AI data for dexterous hands**, capable of generating **high-quality multi-modal real hand interaction data** in bulk.

## Degrees of Freedom
Academically, the full range of motion of the hand is generally categorized as having 21 degrees of freedom (excluding the wrist) or 27 degrees of freedom (including the wrist). This solution truly encompasses the complete range of motion of the human hand, including numerous joint degrees of freedom often simplified or ignored in academic studies, resulting in unmatched detail-tracking capabilities.

## Precision
Hand motion capture is an extremely complex system, and currently, no standard method exists to quantitatively measure error or to compare this solution quantitatively with others. By qualitatively analyzing the rendering results alongside recordings of real movements, it is apparent that this solution achieves a level of precision that far surpasses any known alternatives.

## Latency
| Process                      | Time        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Computation                  | <1ms        |
| Wireless (BLE 5.2 protocol)  | 7.5-12.5ms  |
| Wired (USB 2.0 protocol)     | <1ms        |

Note: Video demonstrations use USB wired transmission, and the display hardware itself is limited to a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz.

## Self-Calibration
In theory, users do not need to perform any manual calibration after purchase. Mastery can self-calibrate during regular use through adaptive algorithms. This approach differs from most known wearable hand-tracking devices, which require users to perform specific gestures—such as making a fist or spreading fingers—before each use (and sometimes even before every startup).

## Pinch Detection
With the support of dedicated hardware, this technology enables accurate single-hand pinch detection at key points, such as the touch of two fingertips. Based on this, it can achieve millimeter-level precision, allowing accurate triggering of functions like button presses or sliding motions within a movement scale of 1 millimeter.

Compared to vision-based solutions that require the hand to stay within the camera's field of view and involve relatively larger pinch movements, this solution significantly enhances user experience and reduces user fatigue.

## Stability
Unlike **9-axis IMU** systems, this solution remains unaffected by **magnetic fields** or **ferromagnetic materials**.

Unlike **electromagnetic** systems, this solution is not influenced by nearby **metallic objects**.

Unlike **strain and bend sensors**, this solution minimizes issues like **sensor aging** and **parameter drift**.

Unlike **computer vision** solutions, this solution is immune to challenges such as **lighting conditions** and **visual occlusion**.

## Wearability
Only two steps are needed: put on the glove and secure the Velcro around the wrist. 

To accommodate different hand sizes, several standard elastic glove sizes are available. Finger thickness does not affect the fit; instead, the glove aims to match different finger lengths as closely as possible.

## Cost
Based on a single glove
